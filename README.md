🌱GreenPulseAI is an interactive AI tracker that helps users and companies assess their climate footprint and receive smart recommendations for reducing it.
The system combines environmental analytics and artificial intelligence to make caring for the planet accessible to everyone.

🚀The main idea:
Environmental awareness, machine learning, and an adaptive interface with localization in four languages: Chinese, English, Russian, and Italian.
The user enters their data-energy consumption, transportation, meat consumption, plastic use, and fuel type.
The AI ​​model calculates a carbon footprint index and provides personalized environmental advice.

🧩Technologies used:
Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript (adaptive and multilingual interface).
Backend: FastAPI (Python) — processes data, makes calculations, returns an index and recommendations.
AI-module: Data analysis and climate impact forecasting (can be trained on real environmental datasets).
